        <h2>My story</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid I was always very active and involved in every sport, I specifically fell in love with distance running. I was pretty good and would definitely put in the work that nobody else would. I was getting better exponentially, but out of nowhere during the racing season, it felt like I couldn't perform the same. It felt like my body was against me, my legs would hurt, my chest would ache, and I found myself slurring my words. I tried to brush it, but it was until my lung collapsed that I realized I couldn't brush it off anymore. I had to get surgery and a chest tube but the doctors said everything else was alright with me, there were no signs of anything wrong with my body. I believed them, but very shortly after I started feeling the same symptoms again. I felt trapped and didn’t know what to do. That was until my mom took me to a doctor that specialized in Contact Reflex Analysis(CRA). This doctor basically could sense the energy moving within my body and immediately could tell I had such a weak heart for someone my age. He said my heart was only working 30% while the doctors at the hospital said there wasn’t anything wrong with my heart. He prescribed me some of the vitamins, which I offer through my evaluation, and they changed my life. After I took them my running performance skyrocketed, I didn't get leg pains anymore, my chest didn’t ache, and my lungs never collapsed again. I trust in these vitamins and I wish more people knew about them, that’s why I created this website. There aren’t very many CRA doctors so I decided I would create an evaluation base on everything I learned from my CRA doctor and other research.
